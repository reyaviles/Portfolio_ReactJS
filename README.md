This is my portfolio! (Version 2)

Entire site uses React JS and Material UI

Portfolio projects are a React component that makes an API call to a data sheet included in web docs. Filter buttons on the Projects page are automatically created using this API call. It then sorts by what kind of skills the user is looking for.
